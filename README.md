# W8-DashBoard

The Vector 8 is an American sports car manufactured in the 80s. Inspired by its iconic dashboard, this project brings a similar experience to your terminal. 

**Early C Project**

Written as one of my first C projects years ago (now making public), W8-DashBoard utilizes threads to create a dynamic terminal display.

# Framework

The project is designed with modularity in mind. Users can leverage the provided widgets or create their own to customize their V8 experience.

# Features

* **Pre-built Widgets:**
    * Bar
    * Line Bar
    * Line Bar Cycle
    * Fuel Widget
* **Customizable Widgets:**
    Extend the functionality of W8-DashBoard by creating your own widgets in C.

**Note:**

This project being one of my first C endeavors, it might be under further development.
